PDFs allow for easy distribution of information and can preserve\\nthelayout and formatting ofa document, making them popular foracademic articles, research\\nreports, and other types of content2. However, one common problem with PDFs in library\\nsystems istheirlimited interaction capabilities.\\nUnlike web pages or other digital resources, PDFs do not have the same level of interactivity.\\nUsers are often unable to search within the document, make annotations or highlight text, or\\neasily navigate to different sections. This can lead to frustration and disengagement for\\nlibrary users, who may prefer resources with more interactive features. Addressing the\\nproblem of PDF interaction in library systems is crucial for improving user engagement and\\nsatisfaction.
